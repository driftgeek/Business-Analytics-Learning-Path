# SAS-Programming-Essentials-I

This is a recordkeeping of my progress of learning SAS.

Lesson 1 and 2 dealt with getting started with SAS. I was able to download the SAS Studio where the coding is actually written in. I learned about the sntax errors, difference between DATA and PROC, and step boundaries.

I already see the difference between coding in SAS and Python.

### SAS vs. Python </h2>

Python is a very basic but very unforgiving program to code on.
